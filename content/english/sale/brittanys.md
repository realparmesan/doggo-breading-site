## Our Stud - Rizzini Quincy 

(Pedigree containing Griz Du Mas D'Pataula & Fleur De Plum Creek)

'Quin' is an exceptionally intelligent, quick, powerful and high drive dog. His sharp mind, biddability and his need to please nature make him a superb hunting dog and an even better companion. Quin has sired two dogs that were selected for the Explosive Detector Unit for AVSEC. With 2 further litters coming from him in 2024 we are excited to see what else his pups can achieve.

## Our Girls - PremierBritt Chanel' No.5 (AUS. Import)

'Pepper' joined us from Melbourne as a puppy in early 2024 and is already showing outstanding promise as a deer dog and is meeting all her marks. She shows a beautiful balance between having an intense drive with an 'off switch' to envy. Pepper will be campaigned in the show ring while she continues her field training and we are hopeful to have some excellent litters from her in the future.
