Our Stud - Rizzini Quincy 

(Pedigree containing Griz Du Mas D'Pataula & Fleur De Plum Creek)

Quin is an exceptionally intelligent, quick, powerful and high drive dog. His sharp mind, biddability and his need to please nature make him a superb hunting dog and an even better companion. Quin has sired two dogs that were selected for the Explosive Detector Unit for AVSEC. With 2 further litters coming from him in 2024 we are excited to see what else his pups can achieve.
